NLP Project
Identify the topic in the news paper

Problem statement With the exponential growth of digital news content, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually classify and organize articles by topic or category. The Indian Express, a leading Indian news outlet, publishes thousands of articles across various domains such as Business, Technology, Sports, Education, and Entertainment.

The primary objective of this project is to build a supervised machine learning model that can accurately classify a given news article into one of the five predefined categories using its textual features like headline, description, and full content.

With the growing amount of textual data, manually organizing and analyzing such content becomes impractical. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a supervised topic classification model that can automatically classify news articles into predefined categories based on their content. 
By using labeled data scraped from The Indian Express, this project aims to: 
    ● Train machine learning models that can accurately classify news articles
    ● Understand how linguistic features vary across different news categories
    ● Enable faster and automated topic-based tagging of large news datasets
            This classification task demonstrates the application of NLP in the field of Media and Journalism Analytics, helping streamline content categorization and aiding in editorial decision-making and media monitoring.
